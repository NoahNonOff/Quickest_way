# Quickest_way
**Goal: Calculate the quickest way between two points** 

## Algorithm
This programm use the *lee algorithme*.</br>
This algorithm works like a wave. Starting from the start point, it will increase itself</br>
as show below:<br/>

Note that the movements are only orthogonal in my programme (but it can totally check for diagonal too)<br/><br/>
### Compiling
* `make`
* `./a.out`
##### After that you have to :<br/>
* select the size of your map;
* select your map;
* select or no the simulation's setting (starting point / end point);<br/>
